SOLUTION OF THE PRE-EXAM QUESTION OF SALES REPORT
===================================================

Breaking down the package into multiple functions and a final procedure which  is a good approach. Each function can handle a specific aspect of the report generation process. Based on our requirements, we can create functions to:

	1. Show items sold in a given branch and month.
	2. Calculate the total sales in USD for a given branch and month && Convert the total sales from USD to FRW using the exchange rate.
	3. Look at sales in other branches and convert them to FRW.


After creating these functions, we can then create a procedure to call these functions and print the final report.


let's outline the specifications for the PL/SQL package with all four functions. We'll define the functions to cover the different aspects of the sales report:

				1. show_items_sold Function:

Input Parameters: Branch Name (p_branch_name), Month (p_month)

Output: A formatted string listing the items sold in the specified branch and month.

				2. calculate_total_sales Function:

Input Parameters: Branch Name (p_branch_name), Month (p_month)

Output: Total sales amount in USD for the specified branch and month.

				3. convert_to_rwf Function:

Input Parameters: Amount in USD (p_usd_amount)
Output: Equivalent amount in FRW based on the provided exchange rate.

				4. show_other_branches_sales Function:

Input Parameters: Month (p_month)

Output: A formatted string listing the total sales in FRW for all branches except the specified branch and month.

				5. print_sales_report Procedure:

Input Parameters: Branch Name (p_branch_name), Month (p_month)

Output: Prints the complete sales report using the other functions.




Now, let's translate these specifications into the PL/SQL package:

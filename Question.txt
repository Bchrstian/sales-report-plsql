been made (The branch). The items that have been sold in the different locations were sold in USD, to convert in FRW where needed, use the exchange
rate of USD 1952. Your O/P should exactly have this Format. None of the values generated in the report is hard coded. The report must display the total amount of sales made in 
other branches in FRW using the exchange rate that has been provided above. A sample O/P has been provided for your reference.
